responsive portfolio homework assignment
https://github.com/slimeforest/responsive-portfolio  -  live site (I couldn't for the life of me get the about me photo to scale properly on desktop)

This project was about desigining a personal webpage that has an About, Contact, and a portfolio section. 

For this project I utilized bootstrap to make scaling across multiple platforms easy and managable, as well as their javascript file to make dropdown menus properly work.

The most difficult part for me was getting my images to scale properly on different web browser window sizes. (I'm still having trouble getting my about me photo to scale correctly)
